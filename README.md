# Design Project Repository

This repository consists of 2 projects:

- Static Thrust Test Stand
- Dynamic Testbench (Project Phoenix)

Both the projects are aimed at improving 2 aspects of further studies and project work in the club: the better choosing of a motor propellor combination and a stand-in aircraft for all sorts of technology and equipment testing.

Both projects are initiated and worked on by members of the aerodynamics club, and mostly by students of the 2019 batch. \&lt;Contact details daalna yahaan?\&gt;

## Static Thrust Test Stand

Efficiency is becoming paramount in design with more complex equipment to start to achieve longer flying times. Data sheets available from motor manufacturers may not always contain the range required for a specific project, or may contain values that are not useful due to variety of equipment at hand. In such cases, having the ability to test a motor and propellor combination in-house will greatly improve the efficiency of aircraft.

The Static Thrust test stand is a simple setup designed to attach to and measure the thrust produced by a particular motor and propellor setup. The setup is designed to accurately measure thrust, power consumed and other key measurables and map them out in an easy-to-read fashion. It comprises of a base frame, a height adjustable stand, an adapter to attach motor to the frame, several measuring probes and embellishments to reduce drag losses as much as possible.

The topics to explore through this project are:

- Application of basics of mechanical design for restricted movement and least stress
- Basic understanding of manufacturing processes like 3D printing
- Basic understanding of fluid dynamics and simulation processes
- Understanding of basic electronics and measuring devices
- Ability to create a software to help map and visualize all measurables

## Project Phoenix: Dynamic Testbench

In the absence of accurate/inexpensive simulation technology and expertise, to have an aircraft capable of testing aircraft-based equipment/sensors/technology without the concerns of cost or crashing would increase the productivity of the club manifold.

Project phoenix aims to build such a testing platform in the form of a fixed wing aircraft, with a secondary goal of standardizing an RC aircraft design process. Project Phoenix is a fixed-wing radio-controlled aircraft with active stability features to improve handling and minimize chances of a crash. The aircraft will have an in-depth ability to morph as per necessity, with standardized mounts to allow any and all equipment to be tested (withing weight, volume and positioning limitations).

The main goals of this project are:

- Standardize the process of building an RC aircraft
  - Wing Design for Lift requirements
  - Tail Design for Stability
  - Control Surface dimensioning for stability vs. maneuverability and payload placement and limits
- Standardize the basics of an RC aircraft electronics setup
- Achieve a crash-resistant aircraft for multiple use
- Achieve a highly modifiable airframe for allowing variety and flexibility in testing
- Be able to measure sufficient number of parameters to collect data for a successful test run

The topics to explore through this project are:

- Wing planform design and analysis for pre-determined lift requirements
- Tail Planform design and analysis for pre-determined stability requirements
- Control surface sizing and dynamic stability analysis
- Proficiency building in CAD modelling using SolidWorks or Fusion 360
- Use of innovative structures to make a lightweight, strong, highly configurable structure
- Understanding basic aircraft electronic setup and how it can be configured for various requirements
- Proficiency in various measuring devices to conduct all sorts of tests on the aircraft
- Learning to fly a large sized micro-class aircraft
